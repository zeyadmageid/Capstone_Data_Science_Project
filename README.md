# Capstone_Data_Science_Project

## Summary
This capstone project will ultimately predict if the Space X Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully.

### context and business mission
-  SpaceX launches Falcon 9 rockets at a cost of around $62m. This is considerably cheaper than other providers (which usually cost upwards of $165m), and much of the savings are because SpaceX can land, and then re-use the first stage of the rocket.

-  If we can make predictions on whether the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch, and use this information to assess whether or not an alternate company should bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
